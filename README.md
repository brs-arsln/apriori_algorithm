Apriori Algorithm on News Database

This project applies the Apriori algorithm to a database of 1150 news articles to identify the most frequently occurring words and explore the relationships between these words.

Project Overview

The main goal of this project is to utilize the Apriori algorithm to perform association rule mining on a collection of news articles. By doing so, we can uncover patterns and relationships between frequently occurring words in the articles.

Contents

- Apriori.ipynb: The Jupyter notebook containing the implementation of the Apriori algorithm and analysis.
- Database: A collection of 1150 news articles used for the analysis.

Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone <repository_url>
    cd <repository_name>
    ```

2. Install dependencies:
    Make sure you have `pip` installed. Then, run:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. Download the Database:
    Ensure that the database of news articles is available in the same directory as the Jupyter notebook.

Usage

1. Open the Jupyter notebook:
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook Apriori.ipynb
    ```

2. Run the Notebook:
    Follow the instructions within the notebook to run the cells step by step. This will execute the Apriori algorithm on the dataset and provide the results.

Apriori Algorithm

The Apriori algorithm is a classic algorithm used in data mining for learning association rules. It operates on databases containing transactions, such as purchases by customers or, in this case, words in news articles.

Steps

1. Data Preprocessing:
    - Clean the text data by removing stopwords, punctuation, and other irrelevant characters.
    - Tokenize the text into words.

2. Applying Apriori:
    - Generate frequent itemsets that meet a minimum support threshold.
    - Generate strong association rules from the frequent itemsets that meet a minimum confidence threshold.

3. Analysis:
    - Identify the most frequent words.
    - Explore the relationships between words using the generated association rules.

Results

The results section in the notebook will provide insights into:
- The most frequently occurring words in the news articles.
- The relationships and patterns between these words.
